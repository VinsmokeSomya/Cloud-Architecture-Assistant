I'll explain the `calculator.py` script in detail and add single-line comments to explain each line. Let me edit the file:

Let me explain the script in detail:

**Script Overview:**
This is an AWS cost estimation tool that helps users calculate the cost of various AWS services. It's an interactive command-line application that:
1. Fetches real-time pricing data from AWS
2. Guides users through service selection
3. Calculates costs based on user inputs
4. Provides a detailed cost summary

**Key Components:**

1. **Imports and Setup:**
   - Uses `botocore` for AWS SDK functionality
   - `inquirer` for interactive CLI
   - `pandas` for data handling
   - `requests` for API calls
   - `yaspin` for loading animations

2. **Main Functions:**

   a. `load_offers()`:
   - Fetches AWS service offerings from the pricing API
   - Shows a loading spinner during the fetch
   - Returns available services or None if failed

   b. `prompt_region()`:
   - Shows interactive prompt for AWS region selection
   - Uses `inquirer` for user-friendly selection
   - Returns selected region

   c. `prompt_service()`:
   - Shows interactive prompt for AWS service selection
   - Allows scrolling through available services
   - Returns selected service

   d. `get_regional_service()`:
   - Fetches pricing data for specific region and service
   - Handles API calls with loading indicators
   - Returns service pricing information

   e. `get_options_list()`:
   - Processes pricing data into user-friendly options
   - Extracts important details like price, unit, and attributes
   - Returns formatted list of options

   f. `get_product_label()`:
   - Creates readable labels for products
   - Special handling for EC2 instances with detailed information
   - Returns formatted product name

   g. `prompt_service_form()`:
   - Main interaction function for service configuration
   - Handles pricing model selection (OnDemand/Reserved)
   - Guides through product family and type selection
   - Collects quantity information
   - Calculates costs based on selections

   h. `print_summary()`:
   - Creates a pandas DataFrame from calculations
   - Groups costs by service and pricing type
   - Shows grand total of all selected services

   i. `execute_routine()`:
   - Main execution flow
   - Coordinates region and service selection
   - Manages the overall cost estimation process
   - Handles the main program loop

3. **Program Flow:**
   1. Loads AWS service offerings
   2. Prompts for region selection
   3. Loops through service selection until done
   4. For each service:
      - Fetches regional pricing
      - Guides through pricing model selection
      - Helps select specific products
      - Collects usage quantities
      - Calculates costs
   5. Prints final cost summary

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Graceful handling of API failures
   - Loading indicators for long operations
   - Input validation at each step
   - Back options in menus

This script is particularly useful for:
- AWS cost estimation
- Comparing different service options
- Understanding pricing models
- Planning AWS infrastructure costs
